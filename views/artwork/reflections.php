      <strong>Reflections</strong> is a generative art installation designed for the <a href="gamehappens.com">Game Happens!</a> 2015 conference. A generative algorithm draws lines using geometry reflections and generates sounds using an oscillator synthetizer. The user interacts with the installation using the <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a> device. The visitor can manipulate the algorithm moving the left and right hands on the three axis. The size of the lines are based on the depth axis. The algorithm chooses the color of the lines and the user can only select the black color, closing his fingers into a fist.

      This artwork introduces the visitor to the idea of algorithmic art, with the usage of interactive parameters to change the behaviour of a software.
