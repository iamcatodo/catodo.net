    <p style="margin-top:50px">
      <strong>Defrag</strong> is a live performance based on a visual and sound defragmentation of photos and music samples. The images and the sounds are splitted into random blocks of data and used to paint a wall of pictures.
      The photos has been realized by <a href="http://www.valentinapeter.com/">Valentina Peter</a>.

      In fields of postmodern artwork, fragmentation signifies the breaking rather than building up of information, to form a structure that would convey a hidden message
rather than the obvious message to its audience. A whole and entire phenomenon
on its own, the postmodernist movement began in the field of architecture but
spread to art, literature, cinema, culture and philosophy in no time.
